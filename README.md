# Regular Expressions - Course Repository

This repository contains code examples, exercises, and resources for learning **Regular Expressions**. Regular expressions, often abbreviated as "regex" or "regexp," are powerful tools used to match, search, and replace text in programming.

## Course Overview

In this course, you'll learn:

- How to use special characters to create flexible text matches
- Creating and using capture groups
- Implementing positive and negative lookaheads
- Techniques to match and manipulate any text pattern

This repository is designed to complement the [Regular Expressions section](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/regular-expressions/) of the **JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures** certification on FreeCodeCamp. You can follow along with the course to enhance your understanding and apply the concepts directly through the examples provided here.

Regular expressions are a versatile skill, and this course will help you master them, making your text processing tasks more efficient and precise.

Happy matching!
